## linking

The following artifact will be available from Maven Central:

    "de.sciss" % "submin" % v

The current version `v` is `"0.2.0"`.

## using

The look-and-feel class name is `de.sciss.submin.SubminLookAndFeel`, which
provides a name `"Submin"` and an id `"submin"`.

Installing this look-and-feel is as simple as the following one line call:

    import de.sciss.submin.Submin
    
    Submin.install(true)  // dark-skin

The boolean argument is `true` for the dark skin and `false` for the light skin.

## building

Submin builds with sbt 0.13. It is written in Java and should run on a Java 6 runtime.

## extensions

Except for the customised look, this library provides the following changes

- `FileChooserUI`: under Linux/Gnome we populate the file tree with the Gnome
  favourites as per `~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks`. To support other window managers
  and other operating systems, we require your help. If you can provide information
  on how to obtain favourites e.g. under KDE, on OS X, or Windows, please let me know.

## to-do

- file-chooser: should not expand the user home tree under Gnome
- slider: looks bad in dark skin
- progress-bar: lacks specific indeterminate state painter
- scroll-pane: corner should not be white under dark skin
- tabbed-pane: border decoration looks bad in dark skin. work-around: use `styleId` `"attached"`.
